There were some features ommitted from the final copy either due to time constraints or not contributing enough to core gameplay.
One of the ommisions was the introduction of shooting and flying enemies. I implemented a prototype of this but overall it was
distracting from the main gameplay mechanic of avoiding the rotating lines. I also decided to use a CC0 backing track and sound
effect as I ran out of time to create my own.
